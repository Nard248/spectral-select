## Overview

`spectral-select` identifies the most informative wavelength combinations in multi-excitation hyperspectral datasets by:

1. Training a convolutional autoencoder on the hyperspectral data
2. Analyzing the latent space to identify important dimensions
3. Perturbing latent dimensions and measuring reconstruction sensitivity
4. Ranking and selecting wavelength bands based on influence scores

This enables dimensionality reduction while preserving the most discriminative spectral information for downstream clustering and classification.

## Installation

```bash
pip install -e "."
```

For development (testing, notebooks):

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

Requires Python >= 3.11. See `pyproject.toml` for the full dependency list.

## Quick Start

```python
from spectral_select import Analyzer, Config, SpectraData

# Configure the analysis
config = Config(
    sample_name="my_sample",
    n_bands_to_select=30,
    model_path="models/autoencoder.pth",
    output_dir="results/",
)

# Load preprocessed hyperspectral data
data = SpectraData.from_raw_dict(your_data_dict)

# Run wavelength selection
analyzer = Analyzer(config)
results = analyzer.fit(data)

# Access selected wavelengths
print(results.selected_wavelengths)
```

## Run the GUI (no code)

```bash
pip install -e ".[gui]"
spectral-select-gui          # or: python -m mehsi_preprocessor
```

The wizard walks you through the whole workflow without writing code: **load → metadata →
normalize → spatial/spectral crop → draw classes → ROI → export → train autoencoder →
select bands**. Step 9 trains the autoencoder (or loads a saved `.pth`) with a live progress
bar; Step 10 runs Perturbation-Based AE selection and exports the chosen bands as CSV / JSON /
TIFF.

## SpectraForge — synthetic ME-HSI data

Generate chemically-grounded synthetic multi-excitation hyperspectral datasets (with perfect
ground truth) to validate the band-selection methods. Define fluorophores → mix them into
materials → paint them onto a scene → render a `SpectraData` cube plus per-fluorophore
concentration maps and "which bands carry signal" ground truth.

```bash
spectraforge-demo -o my_dataset      # writes spectra_unmasked.pkl + groundtruth.npz/json
```

```python
from spectraforge import Fluorophore, Material, Scene, AcquisitionConfig, ArtifactConfig, render, load_builtin_library
lib = load_builtin_library()                         # collagen, NADH, FAD, EGFP, fluorescein, ...
scene = Scene(64, 64)
scene.paint_rect(Material("tissue", {"collagen": 1.0, "NADH": 0.3}), 5, 50, 5, 50)
acq = AcquisitionConfig(excitations=[340, 450, 488], em_min=360, em_max=700, em_step=5)
spectra, gt = render(scene, lib, acq, artifacts=ArtifactConfig(rayleigh_strength=0.15, photon_scale=400), seed=42)
spectra.to_pickle("synthetic.pkl")                   # loads in the Analyzer / GUI
```

The output drops straight into `spectral-select-gui` (Step 1) or `Analyzer`, and
`GroundTruth.informative_bands()` tells you which wavelengths *should* be selected.

## Repository Structure

Uses a `src/` layout (install with `pip install -e .`, then `import spectral_select`).

```

A shared `src/selection_core/` (unifying the perturbation algorithm behind both
`spectral_select` and `channel_select`) is planned — see
`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-15-repo-cleanup-reorg-design.md`.
